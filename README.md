# Log File Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project is a Python-based log file analysis tool designed to automate log file parsing and identify critical patterns or events. Ideal for monitoring, security audits, and troubleshooting, this tool can quickly scan log files for important information such as errors, warnings, and specific event patterns.

## Features
- **Automated Log Parsing:** Quickly reads and processes log files.
- **Customizable Filters:** Allows filtering by keywords or log levels (e.g., ERROR, WARNING).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detects patterns, such as failed login attempts, suspicious access times, or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Export Options:** Saves analyzed data into a report for easy reference.
